4. APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

ROUTING STRUCTURE:
The app uses React Router with protected routes:

Public Routes:
- /                     → HomePage (landing page)
- /login                → LoginPage (authentication)

Protected Routes (require login):
- /project              → VenturePage (unified venture flow)
- /project/:id          → VenturePage (specific project)
- /dashboard            → DashboardPage (project portfolio)
- /settings             → SettingsPage (user preferences)
- /metrics              → MetricsPage (analytics)

Layout System:
- Landing pages: Header + Content
- App pages: Sidebar + Content
- Focus pages: Content only (no chrome)

AUTHENTICATION:
- Context-based auth (AuthContext.jsx)
- Local storage persistence ('capable_user' key)
- Simple email/password login flow
- Protected route wrapper for auth-gated pages

================================================================================
5. CORE FUNCTIONALITY & USER FLOW
================================================================================

MAIN USER JOURNEY:

Step 1: IDEA INPUT (HomePage)
- User enters business idea in text input
- Optional: AI can enhance/clarify the idea
- Triggers navigation to VenturePage

Step 2: MARKET RESEARCH (Server - /api/research)
- Uses DuckDuckGo to scrape web search results
- Fetches Reddit discussions for social signals
- Analyzes market signals with Groq AI
- Generates contextual interview questions

Step 3: QUESTION WIZARD (QuestionWizard Component)
- Presents adaptive questions based on idea
- Multi-select options with location input support
- Detects location-specific vs. global ideas
- Avoids duplicate questions (budget, audience, etc.)

Step 4: ANALYSIS REPORT (Server - /api/analyze)
- Combines idea + web signals + user answers
- Generates comprehensive strategic assessment:
  * Market demand scoring (1-10)
  * Feasibility analysis
  * Differentiation opportunities
  * Risk assessment
  * Primary focus recommendations
  * Mentor questions for validation

Step 5: ACTION PLAN (Server - /api/generate-plan)
- Creates detailed 60-day execution calendar
- Phases grouped by objective
- Each day has specific, non-repetitive tasks
- Location-aware task recommendations
- Deliverables and metrics included

Step 6: EXECUTION & MENTORSHIP (TaskView + MentorChat)
- User tracks progress day-by-day
- Mark tasks as complete
- AI mentor chat for execution support
- Context-aware responses based on:
  * Current idea
  * Action plan
  * Completed tasks
  * Current task focus

================================================================================
6. AI & DATA INTEGRATION

   Purpose: Market research + generate wizard questions

3. POST /api/analyze
   Input: { idea, webSignals, answers }
   Output: { summary, market_demand, feasibility, differentiation, 
            risks, primary_focus, mentor_questions }
   Purpose: Strategic analysis report

4. POST /api/generate-plan
   Input: { idea, report, answers }
   Output: { phases[], tasks[] }
   Purpose: 60-day execution plan

ERROR HANDLING:
- Retry logic (2 retries, 1s delay) for API failures
- Rate limit detection (429 status)
- Graceful degradation and user-facing error messages

================================================================================
7. DESIGN SYSTEM & UI/UX
================================================================================

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary Blue: #0BAAFF
- Dark Blue: #073B99
- Pure Black: #000000

================================================================================
8. DATA PERSISTENCE & STATE MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

STORAGE STRATEGY:
Uses browser localStorage for all data persistence

Storage Keys:
- 'capable_user'        - User authentication data
- 'capable_projects'    - Project portfolio (Dashboard)
- 'capable_venture'     - Active venture data (idea, answers, signals)
- 'capable_report'      - Generated analysis report
- 'capable_plan'        - Action plan data
- 'capable_sessions'    - Mentor chat sessions

STATE MANAGEMENT:
- React Context API (AuthContext) for global user state
- Component-level useState for local UI state
- useEffect for lifecycle management
- localStorage sync for persistence

DATA FLOW:
1. User input → Component state
2. Component state → API request
3. API response → Component state
4. Component state → localStorage
5. Page reload → localStorage → Component state

================================================================================
9. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

================================================================================
12. TECHNICAL DEBT & CODE QUALITY
================================================================================

OBSERVATIONS:
- Some large files (HomePage.jsx: 991 lines, server.js: 746 lines)
- Legacy pages still present (WizardPage, ReportPage, TaskPage)
- Mixed responsibilities in VenturePage
- Could benefit from more component extraction
- Limited TypeScript (using JSX instead)

STRENGTHS:
- Clear separation of concerns (pages/components/services)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Good use of modern React patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Well-documented with comments

================================================================================
13. DEPLOYMENT & PRODUCTION
================================================================================

HOSTING:
- Configured for Vercel deployment
- vercel.json includes routing configuration
- Express serves both API and static frontend in production

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
- VITE_GROQ_API_KEY: Required for AI functionality
- PORT: Defaults to 3001

BUILD PROCESS:
1. Vite builds frontend to /dist
2. Express serves /dist statically
3. API routes remain at /api/*
4. SPA routing handled via catch-all

PRODUCTION READINESS:
✓ Static build configured
✓ API routing set up
✓ CORS configured
✓ Error handling present
✗ Missing: Database integration
✗ Missing: Production authentication
✗ Missing: Rate limiting
✗ Missing: Monitoring/logging

================================================================================
14. SUMMARY
================================================================================

"Capable" is a sophisticated, AI-powered strategic advisor platform that helps
entrepreneurs transform business ideas into actionable plans. The application
combines modern web technologies (React, Vite, Tailwind) with AI capabilities
(Groq/Llama) and real-time market research to provide a comprehensive venture
validation and execution tool.

The codebase demonstrates strong frontend engineering with premium UI/UX design,
thoughtful animations, and a clean component architecture. The backend provides
a robust API layer for AI integration and web scraping. However, the current
implementation relies on localStorage and lacks production-grade persistence
and authentication systems.

The project is in active development with consistent UI refinements and feature
additions. Recent focus has been on enhancing visual appeal through glassmor-
phism, animated gradients, and scroll-triggered animations—all aimed at creating
a premium, modern user experience.

KEY METRICS:
- Total Source Files: ~40+ files
- Lines of Frontend Code: ~3,000+ lines
- Lines of Backend Code: ~750 lines
- Major Dependencies: 15+
- Active Development Time: 4+ months (based on conversation history)
- Current Status: Pre-launch / Beta

IDEAL USER:
- Early-stage entrepreneurs
- Product teams exploring new ideas
- Founders seeking market validation
- Business strategists needing execution plans

VALUE PROPOSITION:
"Transform your business idea into a validated, actionable 60-day execution 
plan—powered by AI and real-time market signals."
